# Ende Phonology
This repository is (currently) used for code related to the analysis of the phonological status of /n/ elision in the Ende copula. The data were collected by Kate Lindsey and the Ende Lanugage project. The analysis is an extension of the method described in Shaw and Kawahara (2018).
